# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. The "processed_moments.csv" file contains the survey data from 100000 clients
across the global. It was produced by using "Text_Processing.rmd" produced by professor 
Tian Zheng. The dataset contains the cleaned and stemed text data so that I can directly 
use these data to analyze.
