### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: What makes different age people happy?
+ This project is conducted by Jay Mu

+ Project summary: This project is exploring the difference of moments that make people happy among 4 different age groups. The process of the project contains : Cleaning the data; Split the data; creating the wordclouds; doing sentiments analysis and topic modelling. I am trying to figure out which moments are most common used in each age group; the difference moments among these groups and why there are such difference. Even though the results are not that correct, but this is the first step of me to dug deep into text mining problems.
